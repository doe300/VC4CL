/*!
 * OpenCL 1.2 specification, pages 91+:
 *
 *  A 1D image, 1D image buffer, 1D image array, 2D image, 2D image array and 3D image object can be created using the
 * following function:
 *
 *  \param context is a valid OpenCL context on which the image object is to be created.
 *
 *  \param flags is a bit-field that is used to specify allocation and usage information about the image memory object
 * being created and is described in table 5.3. For all image types except CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE1D_BUFFER , if value
 * specified for flags is 0, the default is used which is CL_MEM_READ_WRITE . For CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE1D_BUFFER image
 * type, if the CL_MEM_READ_WRITE , CL_MEM_READ_ONLY or CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY values are not specified in flags, they are
 * inherited from the corresponding memory access qualifers associated with buffer. The CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR ,
 *  CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR and CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR values cannot be specified in flags but are inherited from the
 * corresponding memory access qualifiers associated with buffer. If CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR is specified in the memory
 * access qualifier values associated with buffer it does not imply any additional copies when the sub-buffer is
 * created from buffer. If the CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY , CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY or CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS values are not
 * specified in flags, they are inherited from the corresponding memory access qualifiers associated with buffer.
 *
 *  \param image_format is a pointer to a structure that describes format properties of the image to be allocated.
 *  Refer to section 5.3.1.1 for a detailed description of the image format descriptor.
 *
 *  \param image_desc is a pointer to a structure that describes type and dimensions of the image to be allocated.
 *  Refer to section 5.3.1.2 for a detailed description of the image descriptor.
 *
 *  \param host_ptr is a pointer to the image data that may already be allocated by the application.
 *  Refer to table below for a description of how large the buffer that host_ptr points to must be.
 *  For a 3D image or 2D image array, the image data specified by host_ptr is stored as a linear sequence of adjacent 2D
 * image slices or 2D images respectively. Each 2D image is a linear sequence of adjacent scanlines. Each scanline is a
 * linear sequence of image elements. For a 2D image, the image data specified by host_ptr is stored as a linear
 * sequence of adjacent scanlines. Each scanline is a linear sequence of image elements. For a 1D image array, the
 * image data specified by host_ptr is stored as a linear sequence of adjacent 1D images respectively. Each 1D image or
 * 1D image buffer is a single scanline which is a linear sequence of adjacent elements.
 *
 *  \param errcode_ret will return an appropriate error code. If errcode_ret is NULL , no error code is returned.
 *
 *  \return clCreateImage returns a valid non-zero image object created and the errcode_ret is set to CL_SUCCESS if the
 * image object is created successfully. Otherwise, it returns a NULL value with one of the following error values
 * returned in errcode_ret:
 *  - CL_INVALID_CONTEXT if context is not a valid context.
 *  - CL_INVALID_VALUE if values specified in flags are not valid.
 *  - CL_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT_DESCRIPTOR if values specified in image_format are not valid or if image_format is NULL .
 *  - CL_INVALID_IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR if values specified in image_desc are not valid or if image_desc is NULL .
 *  - CL_INVALID_IMAGE_SIZE if image dimensions specified in image_desc exceed the minimum maximum image dimensions
 * described in table 4.3 for all devices in context.
 *  - CL_INVALID_HOST_PTR if host_ptr is NULL and CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR or CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR are set in flags or if
 * host_ptr is not NULL but CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR or CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR are not set in flags.
 *  - CL_INVALID_VALUE if a 1D image buffer is being created and the buffer object was created with CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY
 * and flags specifies CL_MEM_READ_WRITE or CL_MEM_READ_ONLY , or if the buffer object was created with CL_MEM_READ_ONLY
 * and flags specifies CL_MEM_READ_WRITE or CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY , or if flags specifies CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR or
 * CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR or CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR .
 *  - CL_INVALID_VALUE if a 1D image buffer is being created and the buffer object was created with
 * CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY and flags specifies CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY , or if the buffer object was created with
 * CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY and flags specifies CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY , or if the buffer object was created with
 * CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS and flags specifies CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY or CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY .
 *  - CL_IMAGE_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED if the image_format is not supported.
 *  - CL_MEM_OBJECT_ALLOCATION_FAILURE if there is a failure to allocate memory for image object.
 *  - CL_INVALID_OPERATION if there are no devices in context that support images (i.e. CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT
 * specified in table 4.3 is CL_FALSE ).
 *  - CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the
 * device.
 *  - CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the
 * host.

 *  The following functions enqueue commands to read from an image or image array object to host memory or write to an
 * image or image array object from host memory.
 *
 *  \param command_queue refers to the command-queue in which the read / write command will be queued. command_queue and
 * image must be created with the same OpenCL context.
 *
 *  \param image refers to a valid image or image array object.
 *
 *  \param blocking_read and blocking_write indicate if the read and write operations are blocking or non-blocking.
 *  If blocking_read is CL_TRUE i.e. the read command is blocking, clEnqueueReadImage does not return until the buffer
 * data has been read and copied into memory pointed to by ptr. If blocking_read is CL_FALSE i.e. the read command is
 * non-blocking, clEnqueueReadImage queues a non-blocking read command and returns. The contents of the buffer that ptr
 * points to cannot be used until the read command has completed. The event argument returns an event object which can
 * be used to query the execution status of the read command. When the read command has completed, the contents of the
 * buffer that ptr points to can be used by the application.
 *
 *  \param origin defines the (x, y, z) offset in pixels in the 1D, 2D or 3D image, the (x, y) offset and the image
 * index in the 2D image array or the (x) offset and the image index in the 1D image array. If image is a 2D image
 * object, origin[2] must be 0. If image is a 1D image or 1D image buffer object, origin[1] and origin[2] must be 0. If
 * image is a 1D image array object, origin[2] must be 0. If image is a 1D image array object, origin[1] describes the
 * image index in the 1D image array. If image is a 2D image array object, origin[2] describes the image index in the
 * 2D image array.
 *
 *  \param region defines the (width, height, depth) in pixels of the 1D, 2D or 3D rectangle, the (width, height) in
 * pixels of the 2D rectangle and the number of images of a 2D image array or the (width) in pixels of the 1D rectangle
 * and the number of images of a 1D image array. If image is a 2D image object, region[2] must be 1. If image is a 1D
 * image or 1D image buffer object, region[1] and region[2] must be 1. If image is a 1D image array object, region[2]
 * must be 1. The values in region cannot be 0.
 *
 *  \param row_pitch in clEnqueueReadImage and input_row_pitch in clEnqueueWriteImage is the length of each row in
 * bytes. This value must be greater than or equal to the element size in bytes * width. If row_pitch (or
 * input_row_pitch) is set to 0, the appropriate row pitch is calculated based on the size of each element in bytes
 * multiplied by width.
 *
 *  \param slice_pitch in clEnqueueReadImage and input_slice_pitch in clEnqueueWriteImage is the size in bytes of the 2D
 * slice of the 3D region of a 3D image or each image of a 1D or 2D image array being read or written respectively. This
 * must be 0 if image is a 1D or 2D image. This value must be greater than or equal to row_pitch * height. If
 * slice_pitch (or input_slice_pitch) is set to 0, the appropriate slice pitch is calculated based on the row_pitch *
 * height.
 *
 *  \param ptr is the pointer to a buffer in host memory where image data is to be read from or to be written to.
 *
 *  \param event_wait_list and num_events_in_wait_list specify events that need to complete before this particular
 * command can be executed. If event_wait_list is NULL , then this particular command does not wait on any event to
 * complete. If event_wait_list is NULL , num_events_in_wait_list must be 0. If event_wait_list is not NULL , the list
 * of events pointed to by event_wait_list must be valid and num_events_in_wait_list must be greater than 0. The events
 * specified in event_wait_list act as synchronization points. The context associated with events in event_wait_list
 * and command_queue must be the same. The memory associated with event_wait_list can be reused or freed after the
 * function returns.
 *
 *  \param event returns an event object that identifies this particular read / write command and can be used to query
 * or queue a wait for this particular command to complete. event can be NULL in which case it will not be possible for
 * the application to query the status of this command or queue a wait for this command to complete. If the

 * NULL and num_events_in_wait_list is 0, or if event objects in event_wait_list are not valid events.
 *  - CL_INVALID_IMAGE_SIZE if image dimensions (image width, height, specified or compute row and/or slice pitch) for
 * image are not supported by device associated with queue.
 *  - CL_IMAGE_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED if image format (image channel order and data type) for image are not supported by
 * device associated with queue.
 *  - CL_MEM_OBJECT_ALLOCATION_FAILURE if there is a failure to allocate memory for data store associated with image.
 *  - CL_INVALID_OPERATION if the device associated with command_queue does not support images (i.e.

 * pointer to this mapped region.
 *
 *  \param command_queue must be a valid command-queue.
 *
 *  \param image is a valid image object. The OpenCL context associated with command_queue and image must be the same.
 *
 *  \param blocking_map indicates if the map operation is blocking or non-blocking.
 *  If blocking_map is CL_TRUE , clEnqueueMapImage does not return until the specified region in image is mapped into
 * the host address space and the application can access the contents of the mapped region using the pointer returned by
 * clEnqueueMapImage. If blocking_map is CL_FALSE i.e. map operation is non-blocking, the pointer to the mapped region
 * returned by clEnqueueMapImage cannot be used until the map command has completed. The event argument returns an
 * event object which can be used to query the execution status of the map command. When the map command is completed,
 * the application can access the contents of the mapped region using the pointer returned by clEnqueueMapImage.
 *
 *  \param map_flags is a bit-field and is described in table 5.5.
 *
 *  \param origin defines the (x, y, z) offset in pixels in the 1D, 2D or 3D image, the (x, y) offset and the image
 * index in the 2D image array or the (x) offset and the image index in the 1D image array. If image is a 2D image
 * object, origin[2] must be 0. If image is a 1D image or 1D image buffer object, origin[1] and origin[2] must be 0. If
 * image is a 1D image array object, origin[2] must be 0. If image is a 1D image array object, origin[1] describes the
 * image index in the 1D image array. If image is a 2D image array object, origin[2] describes the image index in the
 * 2D image array.
 *
 *  \param region defines the (width, height, depth) in pixels of the 1D, 2D or 3D rectangle, the (width, height) in
 * pixels of the 2D rectangle and the number of images of a 2D image array or the (width) in pixels of the 1D rectangle
 * and the number of images of a 1D image array. If image is a 2D image object, region[2] must be 1. If image is a 1D
 * image or 1D image buffer object, region[1] and region[2] must be 1. If image is a 1D image array object, region[2]
 * must be 1. The values in region cannot be 0.
 *
 *  \param image_row_pitch returns the scan-line pitch in bytes for the mapped region. This must be a non-NULL value.
 *
 *  \param image_slice_pitch returns the size in bytes of each 2D slice of a 3D image or the size of each 1D or 2D image
 * in a 1D or 2D image array for the mapped region. For a 1D and 2D image, zero is returned if this argument is not NULL
 * . For a 3D image, 1D and 2D image array, image_slice_pitch must be a non- NULL value.
 *
 *  \param event_wait_list and num_events_in_wait_list specify events that need to complete before clEnqueueMapImage can
 * be executed. If event_wait_list is NULL , then clEnqueueMapImage does not wait on any event to complete. If
 * event_wait_list is NULL , num_events_in_wait_list must be 0. If event_wait_list is not NULL , the list of events
 * pointed to by event_wait_list must be valid and num_events_in_wait_list must be greater than 0. The events specified
 * in event_wait_list act as synchronization points. The context associated with events in event_wait_list and
 * command_queue must be the same. The memory associated with event_wait_list can be reused or freed after the function
 * returns.
 *
 *  \param event returns an event object that identifies this particular command and can be used to query or queue a
 * wait for this particular command to complete. event can be NULL in which case it will not be possible for the
 * application to query the status of this command or queue a wait for this command to complete. If the event_wait_list
 * and the event arguments are not NULL , the event argument should not refer to an element of the event_wait_list
 * array.
 *
 *  \param errcode_ret will return an appropriate error code. If errcode_ret is NULL , no error code is returned.
 *
 *  \return clEnqueueMapImage will return a pointer to the mapped region. The errcode_ret is set to CL_SUCCESS. A NULL
 * pointer is returned otherwise with one of the following error values returned in errcode_ret:

 *  - CL_IMAGE_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED if image format (image channel order and data type) for image are not supported by

 *  - CL_MAP_FAILURE if there is a failure to map the requested region into the host address space. This error cannot
 * occur for image objects created with CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR or CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR.
 *  - CL_EXEC_STATUS_ERROR_FOR_EVENTS_IN_WAIT_LIST if the map operation is blocking and the execution status of any of
 * the events in event_wait_list is a negative integer value.
 *  - CL_MEM_OBJECT_ALLOCATION_FAILURE if there is a failure to allocate memory for data store associated with image.
 *  - CL_INVALID_OPERATION if the device associated with command_queue does not support images (i.e.
 * CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT specified in table 4.3 is CL_FALSE ).
 *  - CL_INVALID_OPERATION if image has been created with CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY or CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS and
 * CL_MAP_READ is set in map_flags or if image has been created with CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY or CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS and
 * CL_MAP_WRITE or CL_MAP_WRITE_INVALIDATE_REGION is set in map_flags.
 *  - CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the
 * device.
 *  - CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the

 *
 *  NOTE: The pointer returned maps a 1D, 2D or 3D region starting at origin and is at least region[0] pixels in size
 * for a 1D image, 1D image buffer or 1D image array, (image_row_pitch * region[1]) pixels in size for a 2D image or 2D
 * image array, and (image_slice_pitch * region[2]) pixels in size for a 3D image. The result of a memory access outside
 * this region is undefined. If the image object is created with CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR set in mem_flags, the following
 * will be true:
 *  - The host_ptr specified in clCreateImage is guaranteed to contain the latest bits in the region being mapped when
 * the clEnqueueMapImage command has completed.
 *  - The pointer value returned by clEnqueueMapImage will be derived from the host_ptr specified when the image object
 * is created.
 *
 *  Mapped image objects are unmapped using clEnqueueUnmapMemObject. This is described in section 5.4.2.
