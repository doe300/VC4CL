 *
 *  The event object is deleted once the reference count becomes zero, the specific command identified by this event has
 * completed (or terminated) and there are no commands in the command-queues of a context that require a wait for this
 * event to complete.
 *
 *  NOTE: Developers should be careful when releasing their last reference count on events created by clCreateUserEvent
 * that have not yet been set to status of CL_COMPLETE or an error. If the user event was used in the event_wait_list
 * argument passed to a clEnqueue*** API or another application host thread is waiting for it in clWaitForEvents, those
 * commands and host threads will continue to wait for the event status to reach CL_COMPLETE or error, even after the
 * user has released the object. Since in this scenario the developer has released his last reference count to the user
 * event, it would be in principle no longer valid for him to change the status of the event to unblock all the other
 * machinery. As a result the waiting tasks will wait forever, and associated events, cl_mem objects, command queues
 * and contexts are likely to leak. In-order command queues caught up in this deadlock may cease to do any work.

 *  Returns profiling information for the command associated with event.
 *
 *  \param event specifies the event object.
 *
 *  \param param_name specifies the profiling data to query. The list of supported param_name types and the information
 * returned in param_value by clGetEventProfilingInfo is described in table 5.19.
 *
 *  \param param_value is a pointer to memory where the appropriate result being queried is returned. If param_value is
 * NULL , it is ignored.
 *
 *  \param param_value_size is used to specify the size in bytes of memory pointed to by param_value. This size must be
 * >= size of return type as described in table 5.19.
 *
 *  \param param_value_size_ret returns the actual size in bytes of data copied to param_value. If param_value_size_ret
 * is NULL , it is ignored.
 *
 *  The unsigned 64-bit values returned can be used to measure the time in nano-seconds consumed by OpenCL commands.
 *
 *  OpenCL devices are required to correctly track time across changes in device frequency and power states. The
 * CL_DEVICE_PROFILING_TIMER_RESOLUTION specifies the resolution of the timer i.e. the number of nanoseconds elapsed
 * before the timer is incremented.
 *
 *  \return clGetEventProfilingInfo returns CL_SUCCESS if the function is executed successfully and the profiling
 * information has been recorded. Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:
 *  - CL_PROFILING_INFO_NOT_AVAILABLE if the CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE flag is not set for the command-queue, if the
 * execution status of the command identified by event is not CL_COMPLETE or if event is a user event object.
 *  - CL_INVALID_VALUE if param_name is not valid, or if size in bytes specified by param_value_size is < size of return
 * type as described in table 5.19 and param_value is not NULL .
 *  - CL_INVALID_EVENT if event is a not a valid event object.
 *  - CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the
 * device.
 *  - CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the
 * host.
