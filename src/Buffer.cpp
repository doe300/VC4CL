 * 								CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY inside a kernel is undefined. CL_MEM_READ_WRITE and CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY are mutually exclusive.
 * CL_MEM_READ_ONLY				This flag specifies that the memory object is a read-only memory object when used inside a kernel.
 * 								Writing to a buffer or image object created with CL_MEM_READ_ONLY inside a kernel is undefined. CL_MEM_READ_WRITE or CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY
 * 								and CL_MEM_READ_ONLY are mutually exclusive.
 * CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR			This flag is valid only if host_ptr is not NULL.  If specified, it indicates that the application wants the OpenCL implementation
 * 								to use memory referenced by host_ptr as the storage bits for the memory object. OpenCL implementations are allowed to cache the
 * 								buffer contents pointed to by host_ptr in device memory.  This cached copy can be used when kernels are executed on a device.
 * 								The result of OpenCL commands that operate on multiple buffer objects created with the same host_ptr or overlapping host regions is considered to be
 * 								undefined. Also refer to section C.3 for a description of the alignment rules for host_ptr for memory objects (buffer and images) created using CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR.
 * CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR		This flag specifies that the application wants the OpenCL implementation to allocate memory from host accessible memory. CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR
 * 								and CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR are mutually exclusive.
 * CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR			This flag is valid only if host_ptr is not NULL. If specified, it indicates that the application wants the OpenCL implementation to allocate memory for the
 * 								memory object and copy the data from memory referenced by host_ptr. CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR and CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR are mutually exclusive.
 * 								CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR can be used with CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR to initialize the contents of the cl_mem object allocated using host-accessible (e.g. PCIe) memory.
 * CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY		This flag specifies that the host will only write to the memory object (using OpenCL APIs that enqueue a write or a map for write).
 * 								This can be used to optimize write access from the host (e.g. enable write-combined allocations for memory objects for devices that communicate with the
 * 								host over a system bus such as PCIe).
 * CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY		This flag specifies that the host will only read the memory object (using OpenCL APIs that enqueue a read or a map for read). CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY
 * 								and CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY are mutually exclusive.

 *  \param memobj specifies the memory object being queried.
 *
 *  \param param_name specifies the information to query. The list of supported param_name types and the information returned in param_value by clGetMemObjectInfo is described in table 5.11.
 *
 *  \param param_value is a pointer to memory where the appropriate result being queried is returned. If param_value is NULL , it is ignored.
 *
 *  \param param_value_size is used to specify the size in bytes of memory pointed to by param_value. This size must be >= size of return type as described in table 5.11.
 *
 *  \param param_value_size_ret returns the actual size in bytes of data being queried by param_value. If param_value_size_ret is NULL , it is ignored.
 *
 *  \return clGetMemObjectInfo returns CL_SUCCESS if the function is executed successfully. Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:
 *  - CL_INVALID_VALUE if param_name is not valid, or if size in bytes specified by param_value_size is < size of return type as described in table 5.11 and param_value is not NULL .
 *  - CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT if memobj is a not a valid memory object.
 *  - CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
 *  - CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
